# Power-BI-Insurance-Data-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing motor insurance data to gain insights into policy distribution, claim patterns, customer segments, and profitability. Using Power BI, we built an interactive dashboard that helps visualize key metrics such as:

Total Policies Issued

Total Premium Collected

Total Claims Made

Premium-to-Claim Ratio

Average Premium & Claim

Claim Distribution by Vehicle Type, Gender, and Year

The dashboard enables stakeholders to track performance, identify risk segments, and make data-driven decisions for improving business profitability.
